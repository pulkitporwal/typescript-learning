// 
var superHerosArray: string[] = ["Iron Man","Spider Man","Bat Man","Black Widow","Thor"];

// Another way to define above array is :
var alternativeSuperHeroArray: Array<string> = ["Iron Man","Spider Man","Bat Man","Black Widow","Thor"];


// Both are working similar
console.log('superHerosArray :',superHerosArray)
console.log('alternativeSuperHeroArray :',alternativeSuperHeroArray);
